          If you want to learn how to code, taking your first steps into coding
          might seem daunting and overwhelming. Here are the resources you can
          use to give yourself all the help you need, teach yourself new skills,
          and make this learning process fun and exciting.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          This is a post I wish I read as a junior developer.
          <b
            >If you get these foundation steps wrong you could end up wasting
            months or even years</b
          >
          and worst-case scenario you give up on your journey to learn to code.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          From my experience, learning any skill, including learning to code
          requires four main ingredients, namely:
          <b>dedication, time, persistence</b> and finally a <b>direction.</b>
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The fourth ingredient “direction” is often the stumbling block for a
          lot of newbies learning to code, a lot of time and effort goes into
          learning programming languages and frameworks but in the end, they
          find it challenging to land the elusive first coding job. Why is this
          the case?
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          When you do get a job as a junior developer it feels like you are
          starting all over again with your learning. There are so many other
          tools you never came across and most of what you spent precious time
          learning are not even being used!
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          In this post,
          <b
            >I will outline 7 best ways to learn to code that ensure that you
            are constantly heading in the right direction</b
          >, have a solid attainable goal and removes any feeling of being
          overwhelmed during the process.
        </p>

        <h2>THE BEST WAY TO LEARN TO CODE</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          Learning to code personally changed my life and I have seen it do the
          same for a lot of my very close friends too. I have also made a lot of
          mistakes in the process and learnt my lessons.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The steps below are from my lessons learnt, the best way to learn to
          code without repeating my mistakes but instead enjoying the fruit of
          your hard work.

        <br />
        <p><i>Let’s take a detailed look at these...</i></p>
        <br />
        <br />
        <h2 id="s1">STEP 1: WHY YOU WANT TO LEARN TO CODE</h2>
        <br />
        <img src="./img/why_you_want_to_learn_to_code.max-755x400.png" />
        <br />
        <br />
        <p>
          <b
            >The stronger your “why” the more chance you have of actually seeing
            this challenge through till the end</b
          >. A quick warning, coding is not so simple especially in the
          beginning, you need a strong “why” to keep you from giving up.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          I was lucky that I got this step right, I really needed financial
          freedom and poured everything into learn to code for that one purpose.
          Couch surfing and welcoming each new year broke was a huge motivating
          factor for change.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          <b>Below are some reasons most people learn to code:</b>
        </p>
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>Want to earn more for financial freedom</li>
          <li>Have a side hustle idea want to create it yourself</li>
          <li>Hate your job and want a career in IT</li>
          <li>A friend is a programmer and you like their lifestyle</li>
          <li>Need a more flexible working</li>
          <li>Want a challenge & learn a new skill</li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <p>
          From the very beginning know what your “why” is and make it very
          strong because there will come times when you want to give up,
          everything seems impossible and nothing works, this is when your why
          will be your drive to keep going.
        </p>
        <br />
        <br />
        <h2 id="s2">STEP 2: RESEARCH LOCAL VACANCIES NEAR YOU</h2>
        <br />
        <img src="./img/start_looking_for_jobs.max-755x400.png" />
        <br /><br />
        <p>
          It is very easy to get carried away with buzzwords and in tech. there
          are many of them, there is a pressure to learn them all, attempting to
          learn all of them will cause burn-out and in any case a big waste of
          time.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The last thing you want is a nasty surprise…” you have spent 1-year
          learning programming frameworks that no company around you actually
          use”
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          You learnt a programming language because you heard it was cool, you
          chose a side in language war, and picked one that is not popular where
          you are based.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Before learning to write a single line of code, especially if you are
          learning to code to work as a developer, do research into what
          opportunities are around you. This will guide you better to choose
          what you should learn.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Go through local vacancies using job sites, see what is in demand and
          make decisions based on those facts and nothing else.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          <b>Below are some points to look out for in local vacancies:</b>
        </p>
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>What programming language is consistently in demand</li>
          <li>What sort of salary expectation does it command</li>
          <li>What other skills are companies asking for</li>
          <li>Which frameworks are popular in your ideal companies</li>
          <li>Are there more frontend or backend roles</li>
          <li>Would you be happy to relocate for better opportunities</li>
          <li>etc.</li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <p>
          Now you are better equipped to know which programming language to pour
          yourself into, or what framework as well which new buzzwords are worth
          your time and which to learn later down the line.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Don’t leave these things to chance, don’t choose sides in online
          battles e.g ( WordPress vs everything else or Ruby vs Python vs PHP )
          make your decision based on market demand.
        </p>
        <br />
        <br />
        <h2 id="s3">STEP 3: BUILD A LEARNING ROADMAP</h2>
        <br />
        <img src="./img/learn-to-code-roadmap.max-755x400.png" />
        <br />
        <br />
        <p>
          I did not follow this step when I was a junior developer learning how
          to code and it possibly cost me years as a result, this is worth
          really focusing on and taking the right actions from the start.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          A roadmap is essentially a list of actionable steps in your learning
          to guide you so that at any point you know where you are ( what you
          have learnt ) and can measure your progress against what you don’t yet
          know.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          <b>Anatomy of a good roadmap:</b>
        </p>
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>Things to learn directly linked to your current/required role</li>
          <li>You can define items in this list ( know their use case )</li>
          <li>Have a way of tracking completed, current and future tasks</li>
          <li>It is within sight every day, at least workdays.</li>
          <li>Set a particular day/time weekly to take action on your list</li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <p>
          Knowing what you don’t know is the first step in eliminating being
          overwhelmed.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          As a junior developer, I was overwhelmed by how much I had to learn or
          felt was missing in my skillset, and due to panic I would jump to
          learning something new too frequently and in the process never really
          deep learning anything which caused more panic and vicious cycle
          carried on.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Years later I learnt how to create a roadmap and this completely
          changed the game, no need to be overwhelmed because I know it is in my
          plan and I will get to it.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Spend some time to know a list of things you don’t yet know, ask
          questions to know things you need to learn, make a plan and stick to
          it, be strict about adding new items in your roadmap, make sure it is
          absolutely required.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h2 id="s4">STEP 4: START ONLINE CODING COURSES</h2>
        <br />
        <img src="./img/start_online_courses.max-755x400.png" />
        <br />
        <br />
        <p>
          Now it is time for the fun to begin! You have identified what you
          should learn based on job adverts around where you live or where you
          plan to work, it is time to begin the actual learn to code aspect.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The biggest resource in the world “internet” is housing all kinds of
          courses, for all different levels, this is where you should begin,
          some people learn more through videos whilst others through written
          text, find an introductory level course and begin there.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Remember to stick to your roadmap, find courses that match what you
          are looking for, online course sites, youtube beginner videos, blog
          sites all have courses to help you learn to code.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          <b>Here are some course sites:</b>
        </p>
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>
            <a href="https://www.coursera.org/" target="_blank">Coursera</a>
          </li>
          <li>
            <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/" target="_blank"
              >Code Academy</a
            >
          </li>

          </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <p>
          It is also very important to find a tutor that you bond with, there
          are different styles of teaching, so make sure to check different
          courses before you settle for one.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Whilst there are free courses that go in-depth, I wouldn’t shy away
          from actually paying for a course it is an investment in your future
          and one that will pay back thousand times over.
        </p>
        <br />
        <br />
        <h2 id="s5">STEP 5: BUILD A COMMUNITY AROUND YOU</h2>
        <br />
        <img src="./img/join_a_community.max-755x400.png" />
        <br /><br />
        <p>
          If you want to grow as a developer, there is a huge benefit of joining
          a developer community, this is a step every developer of all levels
          should take seriously.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Receiving and giving support is one of the advantages of
          community-based learning, being stuck on a coding problem for days can
          be frustrating, someone in a community has the answer to help you grow
          in your knowledge base.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Sharing best tools and code reviews are also ways of growing as a
          newbie developer, learning best practices and understanding how other
          developers approach a problem will help you when you get into working
          in a team at work.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          It is not uncommon to land jobs or contracts this way too, in fact,
          this has been the case for myself and lots of other developers I know,
          someone in a community works at a company where they need your
          skillset.

          <b
            >This is a secret weapon for any newbie developer and you should
            fight every instinct and go along with it.</b
          >
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Everything you know tells you to study and build amazing projects till
          you are ready then you go ahead and apply for a job, this is one of
          the biggest mistakes you could make. Here is why.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          There is no such thing as “now I am ready” tech. Is constantly
          evolving and you will constantly learn new things, once you start the
          process of learning, begin the process of job hunt too.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          When you have built something, update your CV with the tools used, put
          it out there and begin the job hunt process. The sooner you start the
          process the faster you will land a job.
        </p>
        <br />

          Explain in interviews, where you are on your roadmap, and where you
          are headed, ask for tools they use that you need to learn, explain you
          can easily start those if they offer you the role.

          Take away the fear factor and go for it, there is really nothing to
          lose, look at interviews as part of your learning process and make a
          note of lessons learnt from each interview.

          The last but not least step in the best way to learn to code is
          documenting everything you do. Everything we do today can very easily
          be forgotten tomorrow, and this is not your fault it is just the way
          our memory works, storing information is easy, recall on the other
          hand is not so easy.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Form the habit from early on to make a note of things you just learnt,
          I have a folder which I commit to GitHub called “how-to” it contains
          things I have learnt over the years that I don’t trust my brain to
          recall when I need it.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          For example, whilst installing a database on a new laptop I get an
          error, takes me some time to track what dependency I needed and how to
          fix the error. Now I put that error name in my how-to folder with the
          steps taken to solve it, if it comes up in the future and my brain
          fails me then I know where to go.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          <i
            >This will save you lots of googling time, no need having to do that
            twice! capture it and document it.</i
          >
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          <b
            >Make notes on how to install things, how to debug things, how to
            deploy things, how to test things, what commands needed to spin
            things up, tear things down etc.</b
          >
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Even more important make it public by blogging about them, this has
          added benefit because future employers will be able to get from it a
          sense of what you are capable of more than your CV could ever tell
          them.
